# The Nexus Pod Developer Manifesto

## Core Principles
1. **Sovereignty First**: Your data, your models, your workflows—never leave your pod without explicit consent.
2. **Interoperability by Design**: No walled gardens. Every service must expose a Context-Aware API (CA-API).
3. **Adaptive Intelligence**: AI is a co-pilot, not a controller.
4. **Inclusive by Default**: Supports low-bandwidth mode and bilingual workflows.
5. **Resilience & Longevity**: Modular components replaceable in <10 min.

## Community Pledge
As a developer, I pledge to:
- Prioritize user agency over engagement metrics
- Document why a feature exists—not just how it works
- Submit accessibility reports with every PR
- Mentor one Global South contributor per quarter
- Never build a feature that cannot run offline for ≥8 hours
